    <h1> Mati </h1>
    <p>
        <em> Software engineer at <strong> Veriteer </strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Mat√≠as Navarro Carter is my husband. We met in 2015 at a choripanada en El Oasis, Santiago, and got married two years later on a very windy but happy Northern Irish July day!
        Mati is an amazing self taught programmer, and is my inspiration to learn to code. He is kind, intelligent, affectionate, hardworking, and very driven.
        He is the most important person in my life, and I love being married to him!
