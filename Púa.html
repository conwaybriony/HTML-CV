    <h1> Púa the cat </h1>
    <p>
        <em> 
            Princess of the <strong> Navarro-Conway household </strong>

    <p>
        Púa is our beautiful four year old cat. She was rescued from a cardboard box in the street by our former neighbour in Chile, and then chose us to be her parents!
        We adopted Púa in 2019, and went on to bring her with us when we moved to Northern Ireland in 2020.
        Despite the very stressful journey here Púa has settled in well to life in Northern Ireland, and has enjoyed experiencing new things like grass and snow!
        We love her very much, and our home wouldn't be the same without her!
